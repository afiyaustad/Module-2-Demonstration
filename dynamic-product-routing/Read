Dynamic Routing and Route pattern: 
Demo 2: Create a Product Details page that display details based on the product ID from the URL
Expected output : 
Visiting /product /1 show us the details of product 1 and /product/2 show for 2nd product.
Step 1: Install react-router-dom
Step 2: Setting up Routing in App.js
‘/products/:id’ is the dynamic route where :id is a route parameter
Clicking a product link will navigate to /products/1, /products/2, etc.
Step 3: Create Product.js( product list page)( it consist of list of product and link to their details)
Step 4: Create ProductDetails.js(Dynamic product Page)
This page extracts the product ID from the uRL and displays product details
Here we create useParams() extracts the ID from the URL
It will display products details or show ”Product not found” if the I is invalid
Step 5: Create a Home.js( Home Page)
For better navigation, add a basic home page
